**Empowering caregivers through AI-driven, adaptive support tools.**

---

## Overview

CoCare is an AI-powered assistant platform designed to support caregivers of individuals with accessibility needs—especially in childcare and mental health environments. By automating routine documentation, offering real-time insights, and promoting individualized care strategies, CoCare allows caregivers to focus on what matters most: people.

## Key Features

- **Passive Observation & Logging**  
  Automatically observes and logs daily activities using secure sensors and machine learning algorithms.

- **Personalized Insights**  
  Uses previous logs and caregiver input to create tailored support plans—because one size doesn't fit all.

- **Anomaly Detection & Soothing Suggestions**  
  Detects signs of overstimulation or distress and recommends calming strategies like quiet time or breathing exercises.

- **Smart Alerts Between Transitions**  
  Get real-time nudges and suggestions during key transitions like rest, meals, or playtime.

- **Quick Interaction Tools**  
  Accept, edit, or reject AI-generated reports with a single tap or voice note.

- **Progress Tracking & Visualizations**  
  Track behavioral and emotional development over time to inform decisions and interventions.

- **Privacy-First Architecture**  
  All collected data is encrypted and stored securely, with full transparency and caregiver control.
